Guy

I know this game, but I have no time to play it, plus I heard it is very difficult. For this problem, we are going to guess if the player (The Little Brothers, Little X and Little Y) will be able to complete the game and become the guy. The Little Bros. can play any level in any order, but they must finish all level to become the guy, or they will lose. For the code, first thing first, we have to input the amount of the total levels (n). Then, input the amount of Little X’s level and Little Y’s level, as an array (x[a] and y[b] respectively). The code will combine both array as a new array (z[c]) and delete the duplicate. It will also delete the number above the level, for example n is 5, but then I input 6 in the array element. The input 6 is not counted and deleted permanently. Thus, a clean combination of Little X and Little Y level is created. If the number of combined array element is the same as the total level, they can complete the game (“I become the guy.”), else they break their keyboard and rage quit (“Oh, my keyboard!”).

Worst Case: O(n)
Average Case: θ(n)
Best Case: Ω(n)

Insomnia

Insomnia means difficulty to fall asleep, and to be honest I too sometime have insomnia. Not always, it is only in rare occasion. Anyway, this problem wants us to count how many damaged dragons from the princess’ attack. The code is quite simple, as first thing to do is input the method of the princess’ attack (k, l, m, n) and the total dragons (d). Then, using ‘for’ and ‘if’ function, we can determine if any of the dragon is damaged or run away safely (by using modulo operator(%)). Inside the function, will add the amount of damaged dragons. In the end, print the amount of damaged dragons.

Worst Case: O(n)
Average Case: θ(n)
Best Case: Ω(1)

Lantern

For this problem, we need to find the minimum radius of lantern to light the whole street. In the code, we start by inputting the number of lantern (n) and the length of the street (l). Then, we input the location of a lantern in an array (a[]). After that, we sort the array and count the answer.


Worst Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: θ(n log n)
Best Case: Ω(n)
