<p align="center">230A – Dragons</p>

 <p align="justify">
If you watch anime frequently, you will know that this is a SAO reference. The problem wants us to compare two strengths of our warrior protagonist (Kirito) and a dragon. If the warrior’s strength is greater than the dragon, the dragon lost and he goes into the next level based on the experience point; if not he died. The plot twist is: our protagonist able to fight the dragon in any order. First we input the level of our protagonist (s), then the number of dragons he fights (n). Then we input the strength of the dragon (e) and the experience he gained when defeating the dragon (f). This strength and experience will be transferred into an array, and sorted using insertion array. After that we create another ‘for’ function to call the array; and use ‘if’ function to determine if our warrior strength is greater or lower. If greater, then the output will be “YES”; else, it will print “NO”.

<p align="center">291A – Spyke Talks </p>

 <p align="justify">
Hmmmm? ‘Spyke’, eh? That’s sound familiar… The problem wants us to know which number from the input is double. First, we input the number of secretaries (n). Then, we input each secretary id based on the number (a[n]). After all of that, I use bubble sort to sort it in ascending order. In the end, I compare each of the array’s elements using ‘for’ and ‘if’ function. If there is one pair of same number in array’s elements, then the output (p, stands for ‘pair’) is increased. If there are triple or more number, then the output will simply -1; meaning it cannot be happening. I also don’t count double or more zero; meaning that the secretary that doesn’t answer any call is not calculated.

<p align="center">768A – Oath of the Night’s Watch</p>

 <p align="justify">
That’s a nice quote… For this problem, we want to find a number that is lesser than the max, and greater than the min. In short, we are looking for the number that falls in the middle. First thing first, we input the number of stewards that goes with John (n). Then, we input the strength of each steward in an array (a[n]). After that we determine the max and the min of the array. Finally, I use ‘for’ and ‘if’ function to know if the elements is not the max, and not the min and count it. The output (h stands for ‘help’), then will be determined and printed.
