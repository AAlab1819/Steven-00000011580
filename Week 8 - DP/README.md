433 B - Kuriyama Miraiâ€™s stone

Wow, another anime reference. This problem is confusing for me, not because of its anime reference, but how complex it is. I mean, first thing first, the input in this problem is so many; secondly, there is sigma sign (I know it means sum, but when I first see it, I was a little bit shocked).; thirdly, the example gives more confusion than enlightenment. However, I will try my best to translate the meaning and do this problem as best as I can. For this problem, we need to answer some question from the protagonist, Kuriyama Mirai regarding the infinity stones she has collected. The answer must be correct; otherwise, she will be upset and call you baka. For the code, first we must input the number of the stones (n) and the cost of each stones (a[i]). Then, we input the question she asked (q), followed by the type (t), and random two numbers she told (l and r). We use array to store the number and the code will sort it according to the cheapest value. When all is done, the output, which is the sum, will be printed in the end.

Complexity: O(n log n)

913 C - Party Lemonade

This one is better, more understandable. From what I got, we need to count how many money (ruble, Russian currency) was needed to buy lemonade for the party. The twist is, each bottle has different volume with different cost. So, you have to determine which specific bottle must be brought. For the code, we first input the number of types in bottle (n), and the lemonade required (sum). After that we input the cost of each bottle, which will be stored inside an array (a[i]). After that, the code will count the minimum amount of ruble needed (res) to buy all required bottle.
