For this assignment, we are given two problems from: “UVa Online Judge” (https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php). However, thanks to my classmate, Kevin Jonathan, we only need to do one problem from the two problems given. The problem that he has done is titled ‘147 – Dollars’ and now we only need to do problem ‘10130 – SuperSale’. Without further due, let’s solve the problem! (╯✧▽✧)╯.｡.:*☆

<p align="justify">
From what I understand, there is a sale in a supermarket, so a family wants to take as many items as they can. However, each person only can take certain amount of item and cannot exceed the maximum weight. Our task is to find the maximum item can be brought from the supermarket for the whole family. I will try my best to explain the code, because there are a lot of inputs for this code. For the code, we first input the amount of test (T), and this will also determine the amount of our output. Then, we enter the number of object (N). The next line consists of price (P) and weight (W) of each object. After that, we put the number of people in a group (G). Finally, we put the maximum weight (max). In the end, everything will be calculated using array, ‘for’ function, ‘while’ function, ‘if’ function; and the answer (ans) will be revealed.

Complexity: O(n^2)
